"""Dataset preparation and management for predictive maintenance tasks.

This module provides the Dataset class for handling time-series data preparation,
episode management, train/validation/test splitting, and generation of labeled
datasets for various learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised).

Key Features:
    - Automatic episode extraction from time-series data
    - Intelligent train/val/test splitting with failure-aware strategy
    - Support for multiple dataset formats (RUL, survival analysis, classification)
    - Event data integration and wildcard-based event preference handling
    - Configurable predictive horizon and sliding window parameters

Example:
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from pdmlabs.utils.dataset import Dataset
    >>> data = pd.read_csv('sensor_data.csv')
    >>> dataset = Dataset(
    ...     data=data,
    ...     datetime_column='timestamp',
    ...     failure_column='is_failure',
    ...     source_column='equipment_id'
    ... )
    >>> train_data, test_data = dataset.get_rul_dataset()

class Dataset:
    """
    A class to handle dataset preparation and processing for predictive maintenance tasks.
    This includes splitting data into episodes, calculating sliding windows, and preparing
    training, validation, and testing datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pd.DataFrame
        The input data containing time-series information. If `event_df` is not provided but
        `maintenance_column` and/or `failure_column` are provided, they are expected to be binary
        indicator columns of `data` and are used to derive the episodes. If neither `event_df`,
        `event_indicator`, `maintenance_column` nor `failure_column` is provided, every source is
        assumed to be a single run-to-failure episode.
    datetime_column : str
        The name of the column representing datetime values.
    event_indicator : str, default=None
        The name of the column indicating event occurrence (binary), constant per source. If
        provided, it is used to mark the end of the single episode of each source
        (0: maintenance/reset or censored, 1: failure).
    maintenance_column : str or list, default=None
        Without `event_df`: the name of the binary column of `data` that flags maintenance/reset
        events. With `event_df`: the list of values of the `code` column of `event_df` that are
        considered maintenance (resetting) events.
    failure_column : str or list, default=None
        Without `event_df`: the name of the binary column of `data` that flags failure events.
        With `event_df`: the list of values of the `code` column of `event_df` that are considered
        failure events.
    event_df : pd.DataFrame, optional
        A DataFrame containing event data. When provided it must contain the columns
        `datetime_column`, `source_column` and `code`, and `failure_column` (and optionally
        `maintenance_column`) must be given as lists of `code` values. Codes that appear in both
        lists are treated as failures.
    source_column : str, default='source'
        The name of the column representing the source of the data.
    beta : int, default=1
        A parameter used for objective calculations.
    slide : int, optional
        The sliding window size. If None, it is calculated automatically.
    lead : str, default="0 seconds"
        The lead time for predictions.
    predictive_horizon : str, optional
        The predictive horizon for the dataset. If None, it is calculated automatically.
    train_sources : float or list, default=0.6
        The ratio (float) or list of source/episode names used for training. If a float, it
        represents the proportion of sources used for training.
    val_sources : float or list, default=0.2
        The ratio (float) or list of source/episode names used for validation.
    test_sources : float or list, default=0.2
        The ratio (float) or list of source/episode names used for testing.
    max_wait_time : int, optional
        Controls the maximum length of the profile parameter in OnlineFlavor and Sliding Window
        flavor (i.e. the maximum length of the data used to fit anomaly detectors). This is the
        time the user is willing to wait before detectors produce alarms. If None, it is set to
        2/3 of the minimum episode length.
    in_source_split : bool, default=False
        Whether to select train/val/test episodes from within each source (True) or to split at
        the source level (False). Splitting at the source level is the only way to guarantee that
        no source contributes to more than one split.
    keep_censored_tail : bool, default=True
        When episodes are derived from events, whether to keep the data recorded after the last
        event of a source as an extra censored (non run-to-failure) episode. Setting this to False
        discards that data, which is the behaviour of releases up to 0.0.2.
    random_state : int, optional
        When provided, sources/episodes are shuffled with this seed before being split. When None
        (the default) the split follows the order in which sources appear in `data`, which keeps
        the split reproducible without shuffling.
    DIVIDER : int, default=3600
        Number of seconds a single RUL unit corresponds to (3600 => RUL expressed in hours).
        Ignored when `data` already carries a ``RUL`` column and episodes are whole sources
        (the `event_indicator` strategy and the implicit run-to-failure fallback): that column
        is taken as given. When episodes are cut out of a source by events, a per-episode RUL is
        always recomputed, because a source-wide RUL would not restart at each episode.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sources : list[str]
        Episode names, in episode order.
    episode_to_source : dict[str, str]
        Maps an episode name to the original source it was extracted from.
    rtf_dict : dict[str, int]
        Maps an episode name to 1 when the episode ends with a failure, 0 otherwise.
    sources_for_train, sources_for_val, sources_for_test : list[str]
        Episode names of each split, in the same order as `train_dfs`, `val_dfs` and `test_dfs`.
    train_dfs, val_dfs, test_dfs : list[pd.DataFrame]
        Episodes of each split.

        Allocation is global rather than per group: each group is sized against the *cumulative*
        ideal implied by the ratios, so rounding losses in one group are repaid by the next. A
        per-group allocation would round every small group independently and, because each group
        would then have to be made non-empty on its own, would collapse the realised split towards
        equal thirds no matter what was requested. Non-emptiness of the three splits is a global
        property and is enforced once, by `_repair_split`.
